# geisen
<b>Tool for collecting, and preparing heterogeneous public information on biology.</b>

Named after  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Eisen">Gustav Eisen</a> the – probably still unmatched – explorer, and curator of biology.

# Description

This repository will download public data, and curate them for further analysis. Curation may include clean-up, and reformatting.

# Scope 

It is intended for biological or societal knowledge that primarily refers to genes or gene products. For societal or economic data that doesn't directly map to genes, check the rbusa repository.

# Setup
Define the output paths, the temporary working directory for Geisen, and upstream datasets (e.g.: geisen manual) at the beginning of /src/geisen/inout.py
