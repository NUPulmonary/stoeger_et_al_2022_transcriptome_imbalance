###  Geisen v1.2


New Features:
- GIFtS score (through Genealacart)
- Rosenfeld et al. 2013: gene-specific patents (geisen_manual 1.1)
- Thul et al. 2017: subcellular localizaton (geisen_manual 1.1)
- Genetic Testing Registry

################
###  Geisen v1.1.1

- Fixed SEG: analyze sequence, not sequence header


################
###  Geisen v1.1

New features:
- add Biogrid database
- fix, and thus enable, RVIS and GDI
- add codon bias to genomic_cds

Minor improvements:
- add GXA_ label to GXA datasets
- correct annotation of “km3” cells of Uhlen to “reh”
- split Itzhak into correct subsets (isolating cytoplasmic)
- repackage chromosome dataset to save disk space
- make biosystems loadable by taxon

Unless indicated otherwise, data has been downloaded in February 2017



# aminoacids

Characteristics of amino acids, such as the raw count, but also derivates like isolectric point, and protein solubility.

organization:
by taxonomy id

source:
protein sequences were obtained from uniprot. swissprot (high-confidence proteins) and trembl (computationally predicted proteins) databases (both contained within uniprot), are separated; only proteins which are not a fragment of a protein (that lack corresponding tag in protein identifier) were considered

mapping to entrez:
median

# flybase

RNA expression of Drosophila melanogaster, as curated by flybase.

source:
flybase; only conidered modEncode data; and separated different datasets

mapping to entrez:
unambiguous between ensembl / flybase ID

# genbank

features of DNA, and RNA from genbank. For 20 most studied taxa.

organization:
by taxonomy id
genbank_gene    gene
genbank_cds     coding sequences, computationally predicted
genomic_rna     genomic sequences, computationally predicted
validated_rna   rna, high-confidence

mapping to entrez:
extracted entrez from genbank; for transcripts: median

note 1:
for some taxa some datasets are absent since there is no
corresponding data of genbank

note 2:
in some taxa, RNA curation is worse (e.g.: in C. elegans there is no
non-partial RNA reported)

# genealacart

Data downloaded from human meta-aggregator genealacart (v4.3, February 2017).
Note that genealacart usually does not maintain metainformation. For instance
the original OMIM database would allow more subtle queries

the full genealacart database contains further resources (which are part of
geisen_manual, but have not been included), such as drugs and compounds
to individual genes (or the here redudnant: gene onthologies) and some
commerical databases on pathways (novoseek; geneGo)


organization:
by dataset, split by source, if appropriate

genealacart_encode_amount_of_tfs   # in Enhancers
genealacart_encode_tfs_by_gene

genealacart_phenotype_ontology_amount   # human phenotype project
genealacart_phenotype_ontology_kind
genealacart_promoters_amount_of_tfs   # In promoter regions

mapping to entrez:
through symbol; ambiguous matches (not 1:1) only occured for two genes,
which were subsequently excluded

# gerstein

C. elegans expression from modEncode project, as provided by modEncode
as high level information on the homepage of the Gerstein lab.

Note that there sample annotation is a bit ambigous, and some of the used
loci tags are outdated


# gxa

EBML-EBI processes all public RNA expression experiments by same pipeline
and quality controls. Presently geisen does not inlcude all expression data,
but only a small set of the baseline files that coudld be downloaded
from their webinterfact together with an unambiguous sample annotation

see:
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/home

organization:
matt_antalek_170222     # subset of animals


# interpro

Database, curated by EBI, that aggregates several bioinformatic
prediction databases for any taxon

organization:

interpro_names.csv.gz  # lookup interpro domain to name

# papers

Supplemental materials of diverse papers.

notable mentions:

# radar

Repetitiveness of amino acid sequences. In case of multiple repetitive sequencs, only
the best one is considered. The rationale is that RADAR lists slightly different variants
of the same repetitive sequences as different repetitive sequences.
